# CV Application

* [Live demo](https://main--lucky-pothos-a8c3ff.netlify.app/)

## Objective

To build a web application using React that helps generate a custom CV. Full details can be found on [The Odin Project's page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-cv-application).

**Requirements**

1. The application should include sections for general information, educational experience, and practical experience

2. Each section (or the whole CV) should have an edit and submit button
    * On submit, display the values of the input fields in HTML elements
    * On edit, add back (display) the input fields using the previously entered information
    * Input fields should be editable and submitable

3. Deploy the project using one of these methods: Netlify, Vercel, or Cloudflare pages

## Built With

- React
- CSS3

## Using the CV Application

This simple CV generator requires you to enter information for a given section in the relevant form and displays the information already formatted. A sample resume is shown by default and can be edited by hovering over specific entries and changing the values in the form. You may also delete one or more entries from a section as needed. The project and skills sections are optional so these sections will disappear altogether when all entries from these sections are deleted, but they will reappear once you add a new entry using the form.

## Author's Notes

This project was a nice introduction to React, learning how to save and pass props and states, how to use components, etc. It was a bit challenging to figure out how to structure the different components in such a way that would allow me to properly format and style the elements while also passing props and states down correctly. There is always room for improvement and one feature that I think would be useful to add would be allowing the user to rearrange the CV sections to their liking rather than only allowing it to display in a specific order.
